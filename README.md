## Ruby test

Requirements:

- Do not edit the Gemfile/.rspec file. In particular, do not add any libraries to it
- url_utility.rb should not have compiler errors
- All your code should exist within a single file: lib/url_utility.rb
- If you write tests, these can live in a separate file. You can use rspec for them
